# i have a video game addiction

I have an unhealthy, unsustainable relationship with video games. Given any opportunity
I will avoid responsibilities, appointments, and my better judgement to spend time
looking at the bright pixels and feeling my brain light up.

In my teenage years, I recall feeling that I was using video games to escape reality.
I was bored often and rather that make my life interesting, I would simply hop on the
computer and feel good. The healthiest time in my life was when access to video games
was the most difficult for me. In college, for a long period I had no access to
the kind of computer where I could waste away my life on games so did other things
like attend my classes and do my homework. However, the outbreak of COVID caused me to
bring my work computer home and suddenly I had games in my life again.

There were many reasons that that period of my life was difficult and led to me dropping
out of college, but I truly believe my addiction was a factor. I could tell the effect
it was having on my wife and how my being glued to the screen was hurting both of us.
But I couldn't stop. Stopping meant facing the real world where I had let everything
deteriorate. Spending time in reality made me crave the sweet bliss of games even more.

Fast forward to today and due to significant improvements in other areas of my life,
the real world feels far more bearable. Still, depression and anhedonia come and go
with some regularity. The most recent bout led me to spend multiple days of over 12 hours
bathing in the happy chemicals. In a moment of clarity, I unplugged the whole system and
separated the parts to make the reassembly difficult enough to resist momentary temptation.
Once the craving hit, I decided that maybe I could have an OK relationship if I simply
let video games exist on my laptop. After a day where I stayed up until 4am, I decided
that that could similarly not be allowed.

So here we are. I still have some games on my phone to help pass the time. I don't find
them nearly as engaging (read 'addictive') so I'm allowing them for now. But who knows?
Maybe I'll let those spiral into a problem as well.

Addiction is not fun. It feels like I have placed so much importance and significance on
this ritual of throwing away my time, yet without it, everything feels more dull.
Rather, I let my brain feel artificial highs for so long, that in comparison, little joys
feel bland. I hope to reach a point where I can feel more at peace and engaged with the world
around me, but I don't believe it will be soon. I believe my path forward is simply pressing
on and trying to enjoy what I can.

On a closing note, I would like to say that I do not think all video game use is addictive
and that all players are addicts. There are many beautiful games and incredible experiences
within them. What I do believe is that I cannot maintain the relationship where the
entertainment is a seasoning on top of life. I consistently allow the entertainment to become
my life. If these feelings resonate with you, I hope you can find a happier place in life
where you feel more control over your hours and days. I hope that you feel the necessary
self-compassion to allow yourself the grace to make mistakes on the path to something better.
I hope you feel the love you inherently deserve and I wish you the best.
