<h1 id="i-have-a-video-game-addiction">i have a video game
addiction</h1>
<p><span class='initial'>I</span> have an unhealthy, unsustainable relationship with video games.
Given any opportunity I will avoid responsibilities, appointments, and
my better judgement to spend time looking at the bright pixels and
feeling my brain light up.</p>
<p><span class='initial'>I</span>n my teenage years, I recall feeling that I was using video games to
escape reality. I was bored often and rather that make my life
interesting, I would simply hop on the computer and feel good. The
healthiest time in my life was when access to video games was the most
difficult for me. In college, for a long period I had no access to the
kind of computer where I could waste away my life on games so did other
things like attend my classes and do my homework. However, the outbreak
of COVID caused me to bring my work computer home and suddenly I had
games in my life again.</p>
<p><span class='initial'>T</span>here were many reasons that that period of my life was difficult and
led to me dropping out of college, but I truly believe my addiction was
a factor. I could tell the effect it was having on my wife and how my
being glued to the screen was hurting both of us. But I couldn’t stop.
Stopping meant facing the real world where I had let everything
deteriorate. Spending time in reality made me crave the sweet bliss of
games even more.</p>
<p><span class='initial'>F</span>ast forward to today and due to significant improvements in other
areas of my life, the real world feels far more bearable. Still,
depression and anhedonia come and go with some regularity. The most
recent bout led me to spend multiple days of over 12 hours bathing in
the happy chemicals. In a moment of clarity, I unplugged the whole
system and separated the parts to make the reassembly difficult enough
to resist momentary temptation. Once the craving hit, I decided that
maybe I could have an OK relationship if I simply let video games exist
on my laptop. After a day where I stayed up until 4am, I decided that
that could similarly not be allowed.</p>
<p><span class='initial'>S</span>o here we are. I still have some games on my phone to help pass the
time. I don’t find them nearly as engaging (read ‘addictive’) so I’m
allowing them for now. But who knows? Maybe I’ll let those spiral into a
problem as well.</p>
<p><span class='initial'>A</span>ddiction is not fun. It feels like I have placed so much importance
and significance on this ritual of throwing away my time, yet without
it, everything feels more dull. Rather, I let my brain feel artificial
highs for so long, that in comparison, little joys feel bland. I hope to
reach a point where I can feel more at peace and engaged with the world
around me, but I don’t believe it will be soon. I believe my path
forward is simply pressing on and trying to enjoy what I can.</p>
<p><span class='initial'>O</span>n a closing note, I would like to say that I do not think all video
game use is addictive and that all players are addicts. There are many
beautiful games and incredible experiences within them. What I do
believe is that I cannot maintain the relationship where the
entertainment is a seasoning on top of life. I consistently allow the
entertainment to become my life. If these feelings resonate with you, I
hope you can find a happier place in life where you feel more control
over your hours and days. I hope that you feel the necessary
self-compassion to allow yourself the grace to make mistakes on the path
to something better. I hope you feel the love you inherently deserve and
I wish you the best.</p>
